===================================================

This is a simple wrapper in Go to talk to Flickr.

I wrote this mainly as an exercise to learn Go but it is functional.

The best documentation is in flickr_test.go on how to use this package.

I don't really know Go so if you see something that could be more idiomatic or written better, please let me know!
