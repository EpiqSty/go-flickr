===================================================

This is a simple wrapper in Go to talk to Flickr.

I wrote this mainly as an exercise to learn Go but it is functional.

I don't really know Go so if you see something that could be more idiomatic or written better, please let me know!

The godoc below is the best place to learn how to use this library.
